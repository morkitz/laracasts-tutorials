Generate a new controller:
php artisan make:controller <ControllerName>

For "gulp" to work, you need to install node and npm dependencies-->
Install node and npm dependencies as specified by package.json file:
npm install

Compile SASS into CSS (and other things in the workflow): run --> $ gulp
  - for production run --> $ gulp --production


Make a new migration:
php artisan make:migration <migration_name> [--create=new_table_name]

Run migrations:
php artisan migrate
- rollback: php artisan rollback

Get the php shell to tinker with in the Laravel app context:
php artisan tinker

Laravel DB query builder:
Check Laravel documentation for DB

Create eloquent model:
php artisan make:model <model_name(e.g. Card)>

Eloquent queries --> Card has many notes:
App\Note::all();
$card = App\Card::first();
$card->notes->first();   // here fetch a collection of all notes associated with the cards and then select the first one
$card->notes()->first(); // here fetch only first note of the card

Log all DB queries:
DB::listen(function($query) { var_dump($query->sql); });

Clear cache for fetched data:
$card->fresh();

Fetch card with which note is associated with:
$note->card;

Create new note for the card:
$note = new App\Note;
$note->body = 'Here is another note';
$card = App\Card::first();
$card->notes()->save($note);

or

$card->notes()->create(['body' => 'Another new note']); // for this you have to enable mass assignment for body using the fillable property

To enable mass assignment for the 'body' column of the Notes table -> In the Note class add:
protected $fillable = ['body'];
